I work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and education.
My interests include complex analysis, spectral geometry, reinforcement learning,
symbolic computation, and building tools that support mathematical reasoning and learning.

My work spans research, teaching, and the design of educational and computational
infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on long-term impact and community engagement.
